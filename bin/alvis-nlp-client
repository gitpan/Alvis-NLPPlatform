=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script is the client part of the ALVIS NLP Platform in 
distributed mode. It aims at linguistically annotating the document
sent by the server. The annotated document is returned to the
server once the annotation process. One document is processed at
a time.

The linguistic annotation depends on the configuration variables and
depndencies between annotation levels.

For each connection to the server, the client performs connection ten
times before exit (one second between each attempt).

The INT signal is ignored during the communication with the server to
avoid losing documents (see function C<sigint_handler>).
