Revision history for Perl extension Alvis::NLPPlatform.

0.3    - additional options for the link parser wrapper, to write link
         parser postscritp output (PARSING_IN_P0STSCRIPT)
         and/or link parser graphics output (PARSING_GRAPHICS) in file 
       - bug fix in the default term wrapper (a term embedded in a
         named entity was not detected)
       - bug fix in the default syntactic parser. Take into account
         empty sentence parsing.
       - Modification of the TermTagger : term list is loaded once.
       - Display of the processing time for each step
       - fix a bug in the XML loader of semantic unit/named-entity
       - Definition of a section to manage XML input : the option
         PRESERVEWHITESPACE is set in; addition of the option
         LINGUISTIC_ANNOTATION_LOADING
       - Definition of a section to manage XML output
       - Render time is saved in the xml file (Client/server and

0.2
       -  rename client.pl, server.pl, go.pl, as alvis-nlp-client, alvis-nlp-server, alvis-nlp-standalone
       -  set the default parsing wrapper (forgot in the version 0.1)
       -  configuration files have been moved in the alvis-nlpplatform
       -  writing functions printing header and footer of the
          documentCollection
       -  managing annoation of several document in the standalone
          mode
       - correction in the term wrapper, in the generation of the
         semantic units
       - correction in the default syntactic wrapper, in the
         generationo of the head and modifier element. Corrections
         also reported in the syntactic wrapper in the UserNLPWrapper
         module
       - default term tagger wrapper takes into account given
         canonical form of terms if the term tagger returns it.
       - modified dependencies for syntactic parsing (now needs PoS tagging)
       - control characters are not visibles 
       - addition of an option for preserving or not the white
         spaces (XML blank nodes, but also beginning and end of the
         line spaces). Default behaviour is removing the white spaces.
       - addition of a patch for Link Gramar Parser 4.1a and
         4.1b. This patch adds a option (!whitespaces) to avoid LG
         tokenization.
