0.2
       -  rename client.pl, server.pl, go.pl, as alvis-nlp-client, alvis-nlp-server, alvis-nlp-standalone
       -  set the default parsing wrapper (forgot in the version 0.1)
       -  configuration files have been moved in the alvis-nlpplatform

          documentCollection
       -  managing annoation of several document in the standalone
          mode
       - correction in the term wrapper, in the generation of the
         semantic units
       - correction in the default syntactic wrapper, in the
         generationo of the head and modifier element. Corrections
         also reported in the syntactic wrapper in the UserNLPWrapper
         module
       - default term tagger wrapper takes into account given
